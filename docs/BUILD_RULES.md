# Tycoon Sim 2 Base-Building Rules

This document is the shared ruleset for planning, mapping, and validating bases.
The workbook in `data/Tycoon Sim Database.xlsx` is the source of truth for item
names, variants, sizes, multipliers, ranges, speeds, effects, sources, and limits.

## Required workflow

When a player asks for a base:

1. Build the legal item list.
2. Calculate the ore-value chain and validate every input range.
3. Map exact coordinates and rotations inside the player's plot.
4. Validate footprints, conveyor continuity, turns, effects, item uses, timing,
   ore count, and furnace conditions.
5. Render the completed plan on the grid.
6. Perform a final manual verification before presenting the build.

Every rendered item record must include its database description and relevant
stats so the grid's hover details are complete. The item editor may move, rotate,
or remove a mapped item, but every accepted edit invalidates the prior route
validation and must be rechecked before the layout is treated as complete.

When the player asks to clear the board or begin a new setup, permanently remove
all items, route segments, active-plan data, calculated validation totals, and
other setup-specific state from the previous base. Do not retain the old layout
as hidden, archived, fallback, or saved plan data because it is no longer relevant.

Do not stop after producing only an item list. Mapping and rendering follow
immediately unless required player information is missing.

## Workbook navigation

- `Other Info`: Effect definitions, cosmetic effects, ore-destroying effects,
  and effect interactions. A dropper may explicitly override destruction caused
  by an effect it naturally produces.
- `Stats for Nerds`: Drop-rate, conveyor-speed, ore-size, timing, and complex-item
  calculations. When an item says to refer to this sheet, use its rules here.
- `MPU`: Multiplier efficiency:
  - `MPU = multiplier^(1/length)`
  - `MPA = multiplier^(1/area)`
  - `MPS = multiplier^(1/time)`
- `Droppers`: Starting ore values, drop speeds, sizes, and natural effects.
- `Capgrader`: Legal capgraders, ranges, multipliers, sources, and use limits.
- `Upgraders`: Normal upgrader data, speeds, effects, and use limits.
- `Furnaces`: Furnace multipliers and special conditions.
- `DecoPots`: Conveyor items and decorative items. The conveyor section is
  relevant to route construction.
- `Crates`: Item availability by crate progression.
- `Rebirth Items`: Rebirth-locked items.
- `Achievement Items`: Items that require explicit ownership confirmation.
- `Premium Shop(P2W)`: Paid items.
- `Merchant`: Traveling Merchant items.
- `Items That Lie`: Exceptions where an item's displayed behavior or description
  needs correction.

## Player profile and item availability

- Before calculating an item list, collect the player's plot size, Rebirth/Life,
  requested dropper and dropper variant, crate progression, available item
  variants, F2P/P2W status, Merchant access, Secret ownership, Achievement-item
  ownership, and any exact inventory limits.
- If the player omits one of those answers—or skips part of a clarification
  request—ask for the missing information before planning. Do not infer one
  answer from another profile field.
- If F2P/P2W is unspecified, ask whether the player is F2P or P2W. Do not silently
  assume either status.
- F2P builds may not use any Premium Shop/P2W item.
- If the player is P2W, ask which packs and individual items they own.
- Secret-tier items are never assumed owned. If Secret ownership is not stated,
  ask which Secret items the player has before using any.
- Merchant items require explicit ownership confirmation.
- Achievement items require explicit ownership confirmation.
- Exact inventory quantities are hard limits.
- If no exact quantity is provided, assume an unlimited inventory of every legal
  item, subject to limited-use rules and the dropper ownership exceptions below.
- Prefer the highest owned and progression-legal variant of every selected item.
  This is a preference, not an absolute requirement: a lower variant may be used
  when the higher form would invalidate a capgrader range or when the lower form
  produces a meaningfully better near-cap chain. First try retuning item counts
  and order with the highest forms. If a lower form is still better, clearly mark
  that variant and explain the capgrader reason in the item's rendered details.
- When Shiny, Mythic, or Shiny Mythic forms improve value without increasing the
  footprint or slowing the conveyor, test whether their stronger multiplier can
  remove a weaker item or connector from the route. Prefer the higher-form chain
  when it simultaneously raises the valid final value and reduces total space or
  elapsed time; then remap the saved space rather than only changing item labels.
- A tier or variant attached to the requested dropper applies only to that
  dropper. For example, “Base Iron Dropper” requires Base Iron Droppers but does
  not restrict upgraders, furnaces, or other items to Base variants. Apply a
  build-wide tier restriction only when the player explicitly states one.
- Rebirth and Achievement droppers are limited to one copy each.
- Before using a Secret dropper, ask exactly how many copies the player owns.
- Base and Shiny versions share the same limited-use pool. Using either variant
  consumes that item's shared use.
- Lunar Landing is the exception: at most one Lunar Landing per dropper.

### Crate progression

Only use the stated crate and earlier crates:

`Basic → Advanced → Factory → Quarry → Futuristic → Toxic → Desert → Fantasy
→ Space → Candy → Periastron → Ancient → Alien → Tropical → Ocean → Trinket
→ Toy`

### Rebirth and Life

- `Life = Rebirth + 1`.
- A player at Rebirth 5 may use items through Rebirth 5.
- A player on Life 6 is equivalent to Rebirth 5.
- Teleporters require Rebirth 5 or later. An ore entering a red or blue sender
  instantly continues from the receiver of the same color, then follows the
  receiver's facing and downstream conveyor route. The warp itself adds no
  travel time; movement across the receiver uses its conveyor speed.

## Plot sizes

- Starting plot: 14×14.
- Mastery can increase it to 23×23.
- Rebirth progression provides 12 additional tiles per side in total.
- Current maximum: 35×35.
- The player's stated plot is a hard boundary.

## Item size, rotation, and internal conveyors

Workbook sizes use `WIDTH × LENGTH`.

- North/south placement:
  - Grid X size = item width.
  - Grid Y size = item length.
- East/west placement:
  - Grid X size = item length.
  - Grid Y size = item width.
- Rotating an item 90 degrees rotates its entire footprint, input, output, and
  internal conveyor while preserving its original width and length.
- An upgrader's internal conveyor travels through the full item length and is
  centered across the item width unless an offset is documented below.
  Furnaces are excluded: they use only their documented processing zone and
  never receive a full through-conveyor.
- Even-width items use a centered two-tile-wide internal conveyor.
- Odd-width items use a centered one-tile-wide internal conveyor.
- Gumball Enhancer is a five-tile-wide exception with a two-tile conveyor. When
  facing north its cross-section is one wall tile, two conveyor tiles, then two
  wall tiles.
- Tiki Evaluator is a five-tile-wide exception with a two-tile conveyor. When
  facing north its cross-section is two wall tiles, two conveyor tiles, then one
  wall tile.
- Rotate each exception's entire wall/conveyor cross-section with the item; do
  not recenter or mirror the conveyor independently.
- The remainder of the full database footprint is wall or decoration and cannot
  overlap normal items or external conveyors.
- External conveyors must connect to the internal conveyor rather than to an
  item's wall or decoration.
- Normal items, including droppers, upgraders, furnaces, and conveyors, may not
  overlap unless an explicit exception is documented.
- Some droppers have extended drop points that can reach over nearby items.
  Handle those as documented edge cases rather than as the default rule.

## Ore size and height

- The workbook's `Ore SizeHeight` sheet is authoritative for exact reachable ore sizes and item size restrictions.
- Its left table records the starting ore size, ordered Shrinker/Expander path, and exact final size.
- Its right table lists only items with a current ore-size restriction. A blank entry or an item absent from that table has no known size restriction.
- Slash-separated accepted or rejected sizes describe conditional limits. Read the row's Notes field to determine which threshold applies.
- A route must reject an ore that exceeds the applicable accepted threshold before entering the restricted item.
- Base simulation must report `ORE_SIZE` with the dropper, item instance, incoming size, and confirmed acceptable threshold whenever that check fails.

## Ore movement and removal

Ore must move on an item's internal conveyor or an external conveyor. Ore is
removed when it:

- is destroyed by an upgrader;
- is destroyed by an effect;
- falls onto the ground;
- remains stuck without moving for five seconds; or
- is processed by the furnace.

All conveyors must be physically connected. Gaps cause ore to fall.

### Turns and conveyor safety

- Quarter Conveyor: 1×1.
- Half Conveyor: use for a straight two-tile section when its footprint matches.
- Conveyor: 2×2, speed 12.
- Supercharged Conveyor: 2×2, speed 18.
- Ultracharged Conveyor: 4×2, speed 24.
- Centering Conveyor: 2×2, speed 12. Its walls block ore from crossing the
  closed sides.
- Before connecting a turn or perpendicular lane to a Centering Conveyor, map
  its open and closed sides. The final incoming conveyor tile must touch an open
  side; never route ore into one of its wall tiles. Use a one-tile Quarter
  Conveyor approach and a Half Conveyor transition when a full 2×2 turn would
  feed a closed side.
- Conveyor Wall: 1×2 and occupies its own placement space; it does not overlap a
  conveyor.
- Prefer faster conveyors on safe straight sections.
- Slow ore before a turn when practical.
- Ore may turn safely at speeds through 16.8. At speed 17 or higher, use a
  correctly placed Conveyor Wall or slow the ore before the turn.
- Use Quarter Conveyors for compact turns. For gap bridging and straight
  sections, use the fastest safe conveyor that fits the available space so ore
  reaches the furnace sooner.
- After a Quarter Conveyor has redirected the ore, do not place a second
  parallel Quarter Conveyor directly beneath or beside that completed corner.
  Keep only the actual corner and any forward conveyor tiles required to reach
  the next item. Parallel tiles before the turn may still be necessary to catch
  the ore's incoming lane.
- A 2×2 block made only from Quarter Conveyors should normally be replaced by the
  appropriate 2×2 conveyor unless the individual Quarter directions are required.
- Two side-by-side Quarter Conveyors that face the same direction and occupy the
  same 2×1 footprint as a Half Conveyor must be replaced by one Half Conveyor.
  Keep separate Quarters only when their directions differ or their placement
  cannot be represented by the rotated Half Conveyor footprint.
- Apply this compression largest-first: four aligned Quarters become one full
  2×2 conveyor, not two Half Conveyors. Likewise, two aligned Half Conveyors
  that form a straight 2×2 footprint become one Normal Conveyor or faster legal
  full-size conveyor.
- A straight 2×2 block whose four Quarter Conveyors all face the same direction
  must be replaced by a Normal Conveyor or a faster legal 2×2 conveyor. The
  only exception is a true turn/merge whose individual tiles require different
  directions.
- At the turn itself, every tile in the turning column must face the new travel
  direction. For example, when the eastbound lane turns south at `AH17:AH18`,
  both `AH17` and `AH18` face south rather than east.
- Centering Conveyors, Orbital Messenger, Clockwork Upgrader, and teleporters
  center ore.
- A centering item can appear earlier on the same uninterrupted line; it does not
  need to be immediately before a centered upgrader.
- Side-fed droppers place ore toward that side. Droppers aligned with the route
  spawn ore in the center.
- Before finalizing a collector, verify the exact landing half for every
  dropper. When all ores must land on one side, use individual Quarter
  Conveyors for that side instead of a full 2×2 conveyor that exposes the wrong
  half, and move/rotate side-fed droppers until every drop point reaches the
  intended conveyor tiles.
- T-junction merges are allowed.

## Dropper selection and the ore cap

- The base may contain at most 100 ores.
- The workbook's drop-speed calculation returns the interval for one ore.
- Example: Drop Speed 2 means two ores per second, or one ore every 0.5 seconds.
- Estimate steady-state ore count per dropper:
  `drop rate (ores/sec) × that dropper's travel time to the furnace`.
- For droppers with different entry positions, calculate each travel time
  separately and sum their estimated ore counts.
- Clamp the active estimate to the 100-ore base cap and also report the uncapped
  projection.
- When the base reaches 100 ores, droppers pause until an ore is removed. Which
  paused dropper resumes next is unpredictable and must not be used as a routing
  or value assumption.
- Always use the dropper the player requests, regardless of its drop speed.
- A Rebirth or Achievement dropper is limited to one copy, so use that single
  dropper at its actual speed.
- For a Secret dropper, ask how many copies the player owns before planning.
- If the requested dropper cannot provide enough ore and plot space permits, add
  other legal dropper types to raise production. Respect the player's progression,
  ownership, inventory, and item restrictions when choosing those additional
  droppers.
- Choose the total dropper mix from calculated travel time. Do not add excessive
  production that fills the cap much earlier than needed unless the player
  explicitly wants a cap-saturated build.

## Timing calculation

For every traveled item or conveyor section:

`time in seconds = length in tiles × 3 ÷ conveyor speed`

Sum the traveled lengths along the ore's actual centerline. Do not count parallel
width tiles as additional route length. By default, a furnace has a centered 2×2
processing zone. Route the ore into that zone. Processing is immediate when the
ore touches it, so do not add time beyond the travel time required to reach the
zone unless the database explicitly documents an additional delay.

Furnace processing-zone exceptions:

- Krakatoa has a centered 2×1 processing zone rather than a 2×2 zone.
- Proficient Furnace and Toxic Wasteland have a 2×2 processing zone in a corner.
  When facing south, the zone is in the bottom-left corner of the furnace
  footprint. Rotate that corner position with the furnace for every other facing.

## Expected cash per minute

When the expected furnace cash-in value and furnace entry rate are known, report:

`expected cash/min = expected cash per accepted ore × furnace entries/min`

- Prefer a measured or otherwise known furnace entry rate when the player
  supplies one.
- When estimating, calculate the total raw drop rate and the rate-weighted
  average travel time.
- If projected active ores remain below 100, estimated furnace entries/min equal
  the total ores/second produced multiplied by 60.
- If the route saturates the 100-ore cap and no ore is removed early, estimate
  the cap-limited rate as: `100 ÷ weighted average travel time × 60`.
- Count only ores actually processed by the furnace as furnace entries. An ore
  destroyed or rejected earlier produces no cash.
- Destroyed ores immediately free their ore-cap slots. For routes with meaningful
  destruction risk, estimate cap usage from each outcome's time until destruction
  or furnace processing rather than treating every spawned ore as traveling the
  full route.
- Minefield Refiner destroys 30% of ore that reaches it. Apply that loss at the
  Minefield crossing for ore-cap occupancy, item hover destruction, and the
  route's probability of reaching the furnace.
- Chained Tiki Evaluators share the same phase for an ore. Apply the 1-in-3 red
  phase destruction once at the first Tiki; later Tikis in that chain reuse the
  surviving green or yellow phase and do not roll another destruction chance.
  Keep the green and yellow ore values as separate branches through the chain:
  every green Tiki multiplies the green branch, while every yellow Tiki adds its
  variant's additive amount to the yellow branch.
- Preserve those value branches through every downstream upgrader. For Lambda,
  expand each incoming value into its actual surviving outcomes and report the
  expected ores/min in each outcome group. An expected value may be retained as
  a benchmark, but must not be presented or reused as though every ore has it.
- Include probabilistic scanner results, destructive machines, furnace rejection,
  and every other survival risk in the processed-ore rate and expected cash.
- For a randomized upgrader such as Lambda, calculate the displayed expected ore
  value conditional on the ore surviving. Do not include Explosion, Fling, or any
  other destroyed outcome as a zero-value ore in that conditional value. A
  non-destructive bad outcome such as Lambda's `set value to 1` still survives and
  remains in the value distribution and processed-ore throughput.
- Model replacement spawning when an ore is destroyed: the ore frees its cap slot
  at the destruction time, allowing a paused dropper to resume. For cap-limited
  builds, use the probability-weighted time to destruction or furnace processing
  as the slot occupancy time. Only surviving ores that enter the furnace count as
  furnace entries or cash.
- The cash-per-ore input must include the furnace multiplier and every condition
  the build actually satisfies.
- Krakatoa selects its rate per ore in this priority: Fire applied within the
  previous 3 seconds, Frost, any other active effect, then no effects. Read the
  exact rates from the selected Krakatoa variant in the item database.
- Report the furnace entries/min, expected cash/min, and whether the estimate is
  production-limited or ore-cap-limited.
- Display expected cash/min with a magnitude suffix and exactly two decimals,
  truncating rather than rounding (for example, `$297.486T/min` displays as
  `$297.48T/min`).

## Capgrader rules

- Use only items listed on `Capgrader` as capgraders.
- Normal upgraders cannot be used as capgrader starts.
- Apply capgraders immediately after the dropper section.
- Treat the capgrader section as one uninterrupted route block. Once the first
  capgrader is used, finish every selected ranged capgrader before placing any
  normal no-range multiplicative upgrader.
- `Incremental Upgrader`, `Electric Overdrive`, and every other normal
  multiplier with no input range must come after the final selected capgrader;
  they may never be used to bridge Helio, Fusion, Martian, or other capgrader
  ranges.
- Incremental Upgrader is counted separately along each ore route. Base applies
  `1.1x`, `1.25x`, then `1.75x`; Shiny applies `1.21x`, `1.375x`, then
  `1.925x`. Simulation stages retain the use number, applied multiplier, and
  before/after ore values so the result can be inspected on the grid.
- The only pre-capgrader exceptions are the documented dropper-start choices:
  one legal Lunar Landing per dropper or a stronger legal additive start. Those
  exceptions do not permit normal multipliers inside the ranged chain.
- Pick a final capgrader and keep every input inside its allowed range.
- Capgrader ranges are **inclusive at both ends** (player-confirmed in game,
  2026-10-21). An ore worth exactly the upper threshold still gets the
  upgrade (15K on a 15K cap works), and only a value above it (15,001) is out
  of range.
- The first optimization priority is the ore value immediately **before** the
  final capgrader. Bring that input as close as practical to the final
  capgrader's upper threshold, up to and including the threshold itself, but
  never above it.
- Measure and report the remaining gap between the planned input and the final
  capgrader's upper threshold. A faster or smaller chain must not be chosen when
  it leaves a meaningfully larger cap gap.
- An input within 5% below the final capgrader's upper threshold qualifies as
  near-cap. Inside that 5% band, time and space may take priority only when the
  saved space enables a stronger later multiplier or otherwise improves expected
  cash/min. If space is not constrained, continue favoring the closer cap input.
- Example: for a final capgrader with a 135K upper threshold, prefer an input
  close to 134K–135K (exactly 135K is ideal) over an input near 101K, even when
  the 101K chain is faster or shorter.
- A high-cap item may appear later if its input is still within range.
- Capgrader scanners such as Precision, Ancient, and Azure may only be the final
  capgrader because their upgrades are not guaranteed. This final-capgrader rule
  does not apply to normal post-capgrader items such as Star Scanner.
- Do not select a tiny shortcut that merely reaches the final capgrader's minimum
  unless the player explicitly requests absolute minimum time.
- Capgrader-chain optimization is lexicographic:
  1. reach the final capgrader's 5% near-cap band whenever practical;
  2. inside that band, maximize expected cash/min for the completed base;
  3. accept a larger cap gap only when saved time/space enables a stronger later
     multiplier or another net cash/min improvement;
  4. when the saved space produces no downstream benefit, prefer the closer cap
     input;
  5. use elapsed time and total occupied space as final tie-breakers.
- Only prioritize absolute minimum time over reaching the 5% near-cap band when
  the player explicitly asks for that objective.

### Additive starts and Lunar Landing

- One Lunar Landing per dropper is available whenever Lunar Landing comes from a
  crate the player can access. It does not require separate player permission.
- When Lunar Landing is selected, it must be that dropper's first upgrader.
- Compare Lunar Landing's effective multiplier with every legal additive
  upgrader available to that player. Use Lunar Landing when it provides the
  larger upgrade; use the additive upgrader instead when the additive provides
  the larger upgrade.
- Perform this comparison separately for each dropper and starting ore value.
- Recalculate the effective multiplier after every additive use. Do not assume a
  second copy remains the best option.

### Destructive effects

- Avoid capgraders that add a destructive effect unless a legal remover can
  remove it before the ore is destroyed. Ore Washer handles washable effects;
  Oasis also removes Fire specifically.
- Overcharged cannot be washed away, but a later Chartreuse Collider clears it
  before applying a fresh Overcharged effect and restarting the timer.
- A dropper that naturally produces a destructive effect is allowed to give its
  ore that same effect without destroying it when the database documents that
  protection.
- When keeping a timed destructive effect, calculate travel from the point the
  effect is applied to the next compatible remover, effect-clearing collider,
  or furnace processing zone. Ore Flamethrower Fire must
  be processed in under 2 seconds; Dragon's Breath Fire, Nuclear, and
  Overcharged in under 3 seconds; and Toxic in under 5 seconds. Otherwise move
  the effect source later or remove the effect with a legal washer. A route
  equal to or longer than the timer is unsafe.
- Acid Plant applies Toxic. Nuclear Upgrader applies Nuclear. Chartreuse
  Collider clears every current effect (including Overcharged), then applies a
  fresh Overcharged effect. Overcharged cannot be safely washed: Ore Wash makes
  that ore explode.
- Acid Plant only triggers when the ore has no effects at all. Rainbow from
  Prismatic, a possible Sparkles result from Lambda, and every other existing
  effect block it. A successful Acid Plant applies Toxic, so a second Acid
  Plant cannot trigger unless a remover first returns the ore to an effect-free
  state.
- Fire and Frost cannot coexist on one ore; applying both destroys it.
- Derp, Sparkles, Rainbow, Electrified, and Frost are cosmetic effects. Neon is
  a cosmetic material. Their presence can still change item or furnace behavior.

### Randomized and destructive normal upgraders

- Evaluate randomized and destructive normal upgraders by expected cash/min,
  not only by guaranteed survival or cash per surviving ore.
- A machine that destroys some ores may still be optimal when its multiplier on
  surviving ores raises total expected cash/min.
- Lambdas have no maximum number of uses per ore. Three Lambdas are the normal
  recommendation, not a use limit: the workbook identifies three as the
  risk/reward sweet spot between stronger possible outcomes and the rapidly
  increasing chance that the ore is destroyed or ruined.
- For `n` Lambda upgrades, use the workbook's cumulative survival formula:
  `1.5^(n - 1) ÷ n!`. The listed survival rates are 100% after one Lambda, 75%
  after two, 37.5% after three, and approximately 14.06% after four.
- After a Base Lambda upgrade survives, its outcome probabilities are:
  1/19 for 3.2×, 1/19 for +1,000, 1/19 for an explosion, 1/19 for setting the
  ore to 1, 1/19 for fling and 2.2×, 1/19 for 6× plus Sparkle, and 13/19 for
  2.2×. Use the corresponding variant-specific values from `Stats for Nerds`
  when the player owns a stronger Lambda variant.
- Explosion and Fling are destroyed-ore outcomes and must be excluded from
  furnace throughput. `Set to 1` is a bad outcome but does not destroy the ore;
  keep that ore in the processed rate and continue calculating from value 1.
- Three Lambdas have a listed 37.5% total survival chance. The workbook's custom
  three-Lambda comparison lists approximately 40.28% bad outcomes and 59.72%
  good outcomes among the modeled outcomes; use the full probability tree when
  estimating processed ore rate and expected cash/min.
- Because Lambda can apply Sparkles, it must be placed after any Acid Plant
  that is expected to trigger unless a remover first returns the ore to an
  effect-free state.
- If Lambdas do not fit, use the MPU list to compare their expected benefit
  against competing items rather than removing them automatically.
- Star Scanner is optional when space is available. If owned, one is a common
  choice for its possible 3× upgrade; multiple Star Scanners may be spread across
  the route to give more ores a chance to be hit.
- Star Scanner has a successful-use limit of one per ore across all of its
  variants and copies. Once an ore receives one successful Star Scanner beam hit,
  later Star Scanner beams cannot upgrade it again. A missed earlier beam does
  not consume the use, so a later scanner may still successfully hit that ore.
- Expected-value simulation uses each scanner's measured hit chance: Star
  Scanner 30%, Azure Scanner 90%, and Ancient Scanner 50%. A scanner miss leaves
  the ore value unchanged; scanner upgrades are never treated as guaranteed.
- When space is constrained, remove optional scanners before stronger
  expected-value items unless the scanner has better MPU or expected cash/min.

## Normal upgraders and furnaces

- Crimson Pillars marks ore rather than applying its multiplier immediately.
  Each marked ore triggers at a uniformly random time from 1–15 seconds after
  leaving the Pillars, provided it has not already reached the furnace. The
  destroyed ore leaves a phantom zone at that route position for 30 seconds.
  Base zones multiply later ore by 1.5× and Shiny zones by 1.65×, with at most
  three phantom boosts per ore.
- Crimson trigger probability also reduces route survival. If the remaining
  route covers the full 1–15 second trigger window, every marked ore is
  destroyed and that dropper does not count as reaching the furnace.
- Keep marked ore in the ore-cap occupancy calculation until its trigger time.
  For the full uniform 1–15 second window, each marked ore contributes eight
  expected ore-seconds after leaving Crimson Pillars, even though none survives
  the complete window.
- Estimate spawn probability per route section from its share of the 1–15
  second window, expected spawns from the drop rate, and simultaneous zones
  from the 30-second lifetime.
- After capgraders, use legal normal upgraders while space and use limits allow.
- Apply every multiplier in route order.
- Validate limited uses across Base, Shiny, Mythic, and Shiny Mythic variants.
- All variant forms of the same item share one Limited Uses pool per ore. Using
  the Base, Shiny, Mythic, or Shiny Mythic form counts against that same item's
  per-ore limit.
- Additional copies may improve coverage for random or position-dependent
  upgraders, but they cannot exceed the shared per-ore successful-use limit.
- Base simulation must report `USE_LIMIT` on the first item instance that takes
  an ore beyond its shared per-ore limit.
- Place the furnace last.
- Furnaces must face back toward the incoming conveyor line; do not point them
  in the same direction that ore was traveling before entry.
- Connect the route to the furnace's processing zone. The default processing
  zone is a front-centered 2×2 area and does not continue through the furnace
  like an upgrader conveyor.
- Krakatoa is the centered-front exception with a 2×1 processing zone.
- Proficient Furnace and Toxic Wasteland use a corner zone; when facing south,
  their 2×2 processing zone is in the bottom-left corner. Rotate the complete
  furnace and zone together: west = top-left, north = top-right, and east =
  bottom-right.
- Check furnace-specific conditions and use the best multiplier the route
  actually satisfies.

## Portable upgraders

- Portables are normal post-capgrader upgrades. Never route ore through a
  portable beam until it has exited the final capgrader.
- Portables do not contain conveyors. Place them beside an external conveyor.
- A standard 2×1 portable occupies 2×1 when facing east/west and 1×2 when
  facing north/south.
- All normal directional portable upgrade beams are two tiles long and one tile
  wide, centered on the portable. This includes standard Portables, Derp
  Blaster, Dragon, and Ore Glazer.
- Portable Spinner is the surrounding-zone exception: its upgrade zone extends
  one tile around it instead of using a two-tile-long beam.
- Ore Replicator is excluded from the default beam-width rule until its distinct
  upgrade-zone behavior is documented.
- Portable upgrade beams may pass through walls/decorations and may overlap other
  portable beams.
- Portable physical footprints cannot overlap another item or an external
  conveyor. Only their upgrade beams may pass through item walls/decorations or
  overlap other upgrade beams.
- A single portable may upgrade the same ore again only after the ore completely
  leaves its upgrade zone and later re-enters it.
- Dragon's Breath has no intrinsic destruction on its first use. Its second
  upgrade-zone entry has a 30% chance to destroy the ore and 70% survival; report
  that loss through the same per-use RNG destruction model used by Lambda.
- Items, including droppers, may not overlap Crimson Pillars. Crimson Pillars
  has a special drop landing rule: a dropper placed outside it may aim at one of
  its decorative wall cells, and the ore lands on its internal conveyor instead.
  Other upgrader walls do not redirect dropper output this way.
- A disconnected route reports the first grid cell immediately beyond its last
  connected transport component as the ore falloff location. If the route ends
  at the plot boundary, mark the final in-bounds edge cell instead. Do not mark
  a falloff zone when that cell contains another transport component; report the
  loop or direction problem separately.
- Route-gap diagnostics must distinguish an unconnected dropper output, an
  actual empty cell gap, an off-plot exit, a loop into an already traversed
  component, and a connected component whose directed continuation cannot reach
  the furnace. Include the last component, facing, and coordinates.
- Ore Replicator is a portable upgrader. It has an external upgrade zone and
  does not require or supply built-in conveyor speed.
- Normal built-in conveyor upgraders cannot reverse direction internally, so
  multi-pass reuse is generally a portable routing technique.

## Optimization priority

1. Maximize expected cash per minute, including ore survival, destruction,
   random outcomes, furnace acceptance, and ore-cap behavior.
2. Preserve the final-capgrader priority and its 5% near-cap rule.
3. If everything does not fit, prioritize space efficiency and compare MPU/MPA
   by their contribution to expected cash/min.
4. Prioritize travel time when the ore cap is saturated or the player uses
   Throne.
5. Prefer faster safe straight conveyors, but preserve valid turns, centering,
   ranges, effects, and item-use limits.

## Required output

For a completed build, provide:

- the legal item chain;
- grouped calculation tables with amount, ore before/after, cumulative elapsed
  time, and cumulative route length;
- exact grid coordinates and facing direction;
- all external conveyor types and coordinates;
- turn/wall/centering notes;
- estimated per-dropper travel time;
- projected and capped ore counts;
- estimated furnace entries per minute and expected cash per minute when the
  required values are known;
- remaining plot space; and
- a rendered grid that matches the coordinate map.

The rendered grid's hover/editor details must also expose, when applicable:

- ore value before and after each capgrader, size changer, and portable;
- ore size before and after every Expander or Shrinker;
- per-dropper arrival time and time across the highlighted upgrader;
- each Lambda's use number, cumulative intrinsic survival, survival after
  Explosion/Fling, destruction at that Lambda, cumulative ore destruction,
  expected incoming value, and its variant-scaled 2.2×, 3.2×, and 6× outcomes;
- every applied effect's behavior and whether it is cosmetic or destructive;
- for destructive effects, the route distance/time to the next remover or
  furnace processing zone, the destruction timer, and remaining safety margin;
  and
- furnace facing, processing-zone size, placement, and exact grid coordinates.

## Validation and database consistency gate

- Droppers have no built-in conveyor. Render only their physical footprint and
  exact drop point; never draw an internal belt through a dropper.
- All workbook sheets that repeat an item's stat are expected to agree. Run the
  database synchronization check before planning. If two sheets disagree on a
  size, multiplier, range, use limit, conveyor speed, drop speed, or ore size,
  report the exact sheets/rows and do not silently choose one.
- A layout is not validated merely because footprints fit. Simulate a continuous
  ore route from every dropper's exact landing cell, through every external and
  internal transport segment in order, to the furnace's exact processing zone.
- Reject a route containing a gap, incorrect lane, wrong-facing segment,
  unreachable portable beam, disconnected turn, or missed furnace zone.
- Apply conveyor replacement largest-first: a same-direction 2×2 block of four
  Quarter Conveyors becomes a full-size fast conveyor when legal; two compatible
  Quarter Conveyors become one Half Conveyor; two compatible Half Conveyors that
  form a 2×2 block become one full-size fast conveyor.

When destruction occurs before separate dropper paths merge, preserve an
independent cumulative destruction total for every source dropper. If multiple
droppers have the same total, combine their display labels (for example,
`A & B total ore destruction`). After merging, retain those distinct totals until
they become equal; do not silently replace them with an unweighted route-wide
percentage.

## Optimization and finalization gate

- A route that passes validation is only the Step 4 baseline; it is not a
  finalized base.
- Compare validated candidates lexicographically: maximize expected cash per
  minute first, then maximize remaining plot tiles, then minimize end-to-end
  route time. Space or time may never outweigh a lower cash-per-minute result.
- Preserve every legality, capgrader, effect-safety, collision, lane, portable,
  turn-speed, and furnace-zone rule while optimizing.
- Step 5 may be completed only when the selected candidate explicitly records
  both `optimizationComplete` and `finalVerificationComplete`.
- Clearing the board deletes the setup-specific optimization baseline along
  with the coordinate map, validation artifact, plan, and profile. Reusable
  engine code and regression tests remain.
